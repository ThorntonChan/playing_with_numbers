ESource – [ Playing with numbers ]   
Add a new project in a private GIT repository and share with Derek_Justinger@Esource.com  
	•	Setup a project with either Java, or Python.  Projects must include a testing framework.  
	•	Load and compile & build the empty application from an IDE of your choice. 
	•	User Story 1 - The application needs the ability to extract all numbers not accounted for across a series of arrays.  
Requirements  
	•	Generate 3 arrays with 15 random numbers from [ 0 – 50 ]  
	•	Create a service class that will provide a function to extract all numbers between 0-50 not present across all three arrays. These numbers will be known as “available numbers”.  
	```
	•	Example :  
	•	Random arrays [0-5]  
	•	[3,4,5]  
	•	[1,4,5]  
	•	[0,1,5]  
	```
	•	(Example, all three arrays do not include the number 2)  
	•	Setup a JUNIT or PyTest that will print out all numbers that are not accounted for from 0-50 across the 3 arrays.   
	•	Story – The application needs the ability to extract the largest Prime number from the “available numbers” 

Requirements   
	•	 Does our array contain a Prime number?  
	•	Functionality to return the largest Prime number in the array.  

	•	Execute the project  
	•	Provide a main class method to call execute the service.   
	•	Produce a docker image from the compiled project that we can execute.  
	•	Run the docker-image and view the output.
